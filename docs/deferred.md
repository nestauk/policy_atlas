# Deferred seams

Recorded, not built in v3.0 — seams left open per "build light, leave seams." Each is a real
architectural decision to defer, not an omission. Sources: architecture reference §§3–11
(Appendix A; Appendix B), briefing Appendix A, EB build spec, EB handoff §7. Grouped by area.

## Capabilities

- **All capabilities except Evidence Base** — Options Assessment, Impact, Transferability, Value
  for Money, Theory of Change, Risk, Scrutinise/Red-team (Appendix A). v3.0 builds EB only.
- **Options Assessment** consumes EB output + the findings layer to resolve descriptive
  intervention clusters into named, comparable options — the decision-relative step EB explicitly
  leaves out.

## Product / output

- **Export & sharing** — share CTAs, read-only/public links, version-pinned external deep links
  back into the body (handoff §7.3). The primary surface is the tool itself.
- **Cross-boundary traceability** — statement-to-statement cross-artefact tracing; chain-strength
  composition; chain display; version-pinned cross-artefact staleness (behind the
  addressable-span seam).
- **Body-level coherence** — semantic-pass contradiction detection across a selected
  decision-support-body view (never auto-edits locked artefacts).
- **Chart view-types** over structured-content blocks.
- **Summaries as a retrieval-routing signal**
  (route-never-substitute recorded).
- **Artefact-level confidence badge / `ArtefactVersion.confidence`** and aggregate cross-source
  confidence scores (handoff §7.2) — use descriptive factual-snapshot metadata + finding-strength
  language instead.

## Evidence Base internals

- **Consensus / weighted-strength roll-up** — the strength-weighted verdict ("supports X at
  strength Y") and divided-evidence *direction* verdict (synthesise component 9).
- **Relative-to-feasible appraisal tier** + the **full two-stage appraisal pass** (richer
  full-text methods/risk-of-bias on the selected subset) + modifier-tag-driven rubric dimensions
  (appraise component 4).
- **Grey-lit category granularity** — splitting v2's coarse Policy-Guidance / Expert-Opinion
  primary types (classify component 3; needs policy-team input).
- **`implementation_context_finding`** — the second reusable finding schema (mechanisms, barriers,
  implementation conditions); cross-schema linkage is reference-mediated via `group`.
- **Saturation-based search stopping** (iterating retrieval↔screen until no new relevant docs);
  `saturated` is not a v3.0 `search_coverage_record` stop value.
- **Budget cap + lazy vectorisation** for very large relevant sets; the **tiered content peek**
  for poor-metadata grey lit at screen.
- **Graph-structured synthesis** — query-time multi-hop / community / contradiction-location over
  the findings graph (run-local → project-scoped persistent → graph datastore), gated on an
  entity-resolution-quality bar; **never** an ingestion-time global / cross-project KG.

## Data model / evidence

- **`Library`** (curated cross-project collection: per-user → team/org) and **`Connected`**
  (auth'd departmental-repository ingest) — the public/acquired dedup slice is *un*-deferred; the
  curated collection + access layers are not. **Source-class lifecycles** stay collapsed to
  `origin`.
- **Source-document versioning lifecycle** beyond immutable snapshots + a human-asserted
  `supersedes` edge — diffing, upstream-change monitoring, automatic propagation.
- **Open-web `search` backend** (trust class: untrusted open web) — behind the same `search` verb,
  declaration-scoped, with mandatory injection screening; ingests as frozen chunks (no
  cite-the-live-web path).
- **Cross-project finding reuse** (sits next to the rejected global KG).
- **Editing UX** — human amendment is representable in provenance now; the editing *UX* is
  deferred to user testing.
- **Support-direction relations** (supports / caveats / contradicts) + user counter-evidence
  search.

## Execution / collaboration / ops

- **Branch-level parallelism** — intra-run parallel branches with a check-in blocking only the
  dependent sub-graph; a dedicated durable workflow engine; durable timers. (Within-step
  data-parallel fan-out is **retained**, not deferred.)
- **Formal sign-off / clearance workflow**, **artefact-scoped permissions / full RBAC**,
  cross-project nudges.
- **Per-item sensitivity gates & egress control**, **private / self-host deployments** — return
  when a sensitivity label drives concrete behaviour (block / approve / generalise / route /
  private deploy).
- **Formal SLO/SLA, incident process, canaries, live drift monitors, product analytics**, and a
  committed **judge calibration scheme** (owned by the eval workstream; v3.0 only persists judge
  I/O for eval-readiness).
- **Time/cost estimate model** (the plan drives an estimate; the model is deferred — a coarse band
  suffices in v3.0).
- **Forecast/prewarm extraction** — modelled only if built (no inert forecast object otherwise).
